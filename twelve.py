##Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, 
# return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
##Note:You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.


num1=input("enter number string;")
num2=input("enter number string:")
product=int(num1)*int(num2)
pr1=str(product)
print("'"+pr1+"'")
